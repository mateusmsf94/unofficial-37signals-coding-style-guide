# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Purpose

This is a documentation-only repository containing transferable Rails patterns and development philosophy extracted from analyzing 37signals' Fizzy codebase. It consists entirely of markdown files - there is no application code, build system, or tests.

## Structure

- `README.md` - Main entry point with table of contents
- Topic files (e.g., `controllers.md`, `models.md`, `stimulus.md`) - Each covers a specific pattern area
- All content is LLM-generated from PR analysis and should be verified against actual implementations

## Content Guidelines

When editing or adding content:
- Focus on transferable patterns, not Fizzy-specific business logic
- Include code examples licensed under the O'Saasy License
- Link PR references to actual GitHub PRs when available
- Maintain the existing markdown structure and style
